## 🗺️ Next Phase: PHASE 9 - DISTRIBUTED CONSENSUS

**Priority**: CRITICAL - Unlocks multi-node distributed operation  
**Estimated Duration**: 4-5 weeks  
**Commands**: 33-36

### Command 33: etcd-raft Integration ⭐ START HERE

**Setup etcd cluster**:
```bash
docker run -d --name etcd \
  -p 2379:2379 -p 2380:2380 \
  quay.io/coreos/etcd:latest \
  /usr/local/bin/etcd \
  --listen-client-urls http://0.0.0.0:2379 \
  --advertise-client-urls http://localhost:2379

# Add to requirements.txt
echo "etcd3==0.12.0" >> requirements.txt
pip install etcd3
```

**Create Raft adapter**:
1. `mkdir -p src/consensus`
2. Create `src/consensus/raft_adapter.py`:
   - RaftConsensusAdapter class
   - connect(etcd_hosts[])
   - get_bucket_for_need(need_id) → bucket number (0-255)
   - try_decide(need_id, proposal_id, k_plan, epoch) → atomic DECIDE via etcd transaction

**Bucket Topology**:
- 256 Raft groups sharded by `hash(need_id) % 256`
- Each bucket has independent leader election
- Scales horizontally as load increases

**Test**:
```bash
pytest tests/test_raft_consensus.py -v
```

**Checkpoint**: etcd-raft handles DECIDE with sharding ✓

### Commands 34-36 (See COMPLETE_IMPLEMENTATION_COMMANDS.md for details)

## 💡 Key Recommendations

### For Immediate Phase 9 Work:

1. **Start Small**: Implement single-bucket Raft first, verify it works, then add sharding
2. **Hybrid Mode**: Run Redis + etcd in parallel during transition
3. **Feature Flag**: Use environment variable to toggle between Redis and Raft consensus
4. **Spike First**: 2-3 day spike to prove etcd transactions work for DECIDE
5. **Test Early**: Write tests before implementation to clarify requirements

### Team Structure (if you have multiple people):

**3-Person Team**:
- Person A: Phase 9 (Distributed Consensus) - Critical path
- Person B: Phase 12 (IPFS CAS) - Parallel, independent
- Person C: Phase 11 (WASM Policy) - Parallel, independent

**1-Person Team**:
- Sequential: 9 → 10 → 12 → 11 → 13 → ...

✅ **Scalable**: Cross-shard, 256-bucket Raft, intelligent routing  
✅ **Open**: Permissionless agent economy with DIDs  
✅ **Auditable**: Deterministic replay from signed checkpointed logs  
✅ **Resilient**: Survives partitions, failures, attacks  
✅ **Efficient**: Local-first, delta prompts, tool-first, gas-metered  
✅ **Verifiable**: Quorum-based finality, formal properties  
✅ **Production-Ready**: Monitored, chaos-tested, optimized
